Version 1.0.3 - Aug 09, 2019

Shows the number of Frostbolts you can currently cast (or Rank 1-3 Fireball when appropriate). It will determine your best spell you can use, and will notify you when you have a new rank available to train. Fireball and Frostbolt alternate being the best until Rank 3 Frostbolt at level 14. Primarily used for leveling efficiently.

Open to feedback and suggestions!

## Helper Addons
The unit frames in the screenshots are Luna Frames. Luna also provides the BANGER font shown in the screenshots.

The black square icon border around spells are removed with the Masque addon.

FiveSecondRule is an addon to show when the mana-per-5-seconds tick after last spell cast will begin. Shown as a blue bar in the gif preview.

I zip all of my addons. Scroll down for addon pack description. I also share the macros I use.
